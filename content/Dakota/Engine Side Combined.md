## Notes
##### C130 #1
5V+ should be generated by ECU, may not need this at C130.

##### C130 #2
Sensor ground should be generated by ECU, may not need this at C130

# C3
Both truck's C3 connectors have a few things that are needed like the fuel pump relay.

Keep:
- Pedal connector
- P/S connector
- O2 connectors

## Notes
##### C3 #1
C130 female & hemi C3 are on the same harness. C3 reads TRS P/N from C130. Splice T41 into Dakota PDC harness from female C130

#### C3 #2
Splice in: 

ASD Relay Output 16BR/WT to 14DG/OR
Tcase pos sense K77 18BR/WT

#### C3 #3
PCM from Hemi has an extra starter relay control to ground the relay. Dakota uses park/neutral sense wire to ground starter relay. May not need to connect this wire.
